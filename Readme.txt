This app uses Collaborative Data Objects (CDO), so you'll need to register the CDO.dll as per the below;

C:\WINNT\system32\regsvr32.exe "C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Mapi\1033\NT\cdo.dll"

An alternative is to use Outlook to do the email, but I'll leave that up to you to code it through....I can't make it a walk in the park for you!

Any questions, then please drop them on the site and I'll endeavour to get back to you.

Cheers, and if there are any bugs, stodgy code etc then let me know and I'll try to fix. I hope that you find this interesting and if you do and like the cut of my code, then give me a rating, I get a kick out of it...(yeah I know...get a life etc.)
